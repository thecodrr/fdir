⚡ **Extremely Fast:** Nothing similar (in the NodeJS world) beats `fdir` in speed. It can easily crawl a directory containing **1 million files in < 1 second.**

💡 **Stupidly Easy:** `fdir` only has 2 functions; `sync` and `async` for crawling the file system synchronously or asynchronously.

🤖 **Zero Dependencies:** `fdir` uses pure NodeJS `fs` & `path` namespaces. Nothing else is ever touched.

🕺 **Astonishingly Small:** < 1KB in size

🔥 **All Node Versions Supported:** `fdir` runs everywhere on all Node versions (within reason). And it is unsurprisingly fastest there too.

## Support

> Do you like this project? **[Support me by donating](https://ko-fi.com/thecodrr)**, creating an issue, becoming a stargazer or opening a pull request. Thanks.

## 🚄 Quickstart

You can install using `npm`:

```sh
$ npm i --save fdir
```

or Yarn:

```sh
$ yarn add fdir
```

It makes no difference to me.

```js
const fdir = require("fdir").default;

// create the builder
const api = fdir
  .new()
  .withFullPaths()
  .crawl("path/to/dir");

// get all files in a directory synchronously
const files = api.sync();

// or asynchronously
api.withPromise().then((files) => {
  // do something with the result here.
});
```

And that's it.

## Documentation:

I have written an [in-depth documentation here](./docs.md).

## 📊 Benchmarks:

```sh
$ yarn benchmark
```

**Specs:**

- Intel i7 7th Generation (7700HQ)
- 16 GB of RAM
- 256 GB SSD
- OS: Manjaro Linux
- Directory Size: 9847 files, 1620 folders

**Notes:**

- Some people asked that I benchmark `no-op` (without options) version of `fdir`. I did and found no performance difference. The results were identical. (I didn't include it here as it wasn't anything special.)
- Some other people were doubtful about the authenticity of these results due to _frequency scaling_, _process overload_, _disk warmup_ etc. So I have updated the benchmark with new results that should resolve all those doubts. Here's the process I followed:

  - Hard shutdown the laptop (a couple of times just to be sure) to clear disk, ram cache etc.
  - Login directly to a TTY (avoiding any unnecessary process from starting).
  - Disable CPU Scaling using

  ```sh
  $ sudo cpupower frequency-set --governor performance
  ```

  - Run the benchmark

### Node v8.3.0:

**Note: As latest version of `rrdir` doesn't support Node < 8, I had to use version 2.0.0. Everything else is fully updated.**
